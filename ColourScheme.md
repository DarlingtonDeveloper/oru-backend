# Oru Color Scheme Recommendation

After reviewing the Oru app â€“ which helps digital creatives track and reduce doomscrolling through focus tracking and visual feedback â€“ I'd recommend a color scheme that balances mindfulness with creativity while supporting the app's digital wellness mission.

## Recommended Color Palette

- **Deep Teal** (`#087E8B`): For primary buttons, key UI elements, and brand identity
- **Soft Turquoise** (`#5AB1BB`): For secondary elements and lighter accents
- **Deep Blue-Gray** (`#252D38`): For dark mode backgrounds and headers

## Rationale

### Psychological Impact
The teal/turquoise primary palette was chosen specifically because:

1. **Focus and Calm**: Teal combines the focus-enhancing qualities of blue with the balancing aspects of green, creating a sense of calm intentionality that directly counters the frantic energy of doomscrolling

2. **Digital Wellness**: These colors feel refreshing rather than draining on the eyes, particularly important for an app that users will check after experiencing digital fatigue

3. **Intentional Systems**: The deliberate, balanced quality of teal aligns with your brand proposition of "intentional systems rather than willpower"

### Target Audience Alignment
For digital creatives and builders:

1. **Creative Appeal**: The palette feels contemporary and fresh without being trendy or fleeting
   
2. **Professional Aesthetic**: The colors convey sophistication without being overly corporate, appealing to independent creators and professionals alike

3. **Visual Distinction**: The scheme stands out from typical social media apps (which often use bright reds, blues, and pure blacks), creating a visual "pattern break" that reinforces the app's purpose

### Functional Considerations

The colors support key functional aspects of the app:

1. **Data Visualization**: The range provides sufficient variety for charts and graphs while maintaining harmony
   
2. **Distraction Tracking**: The spectrum from mindful green to subdued coral creates an intuitive progression for tracking distraction levels
   
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: The contrast between elements supports good readability and user focus on the most important information

### Brand Identity Enhancement

This color scheme reinforces Oru's identity:

1. **Target Symbol** (ðŸŽ¯): The precision and intentionality of the target emoji pairs perfectly with the deliberate, focused feeling of teal
   
2. **Name "Oru"**: The simplicity and clarity of the name is complemented by the clean, refreshing color palette
   
3. **Digital Wellness Mission**: The colors feel restorative rather than stimulating, reinforcing the brand's focus on reclaiming attention

## Application Examples

### Dashboard
- Navigation: Deep blue-gray background with white text and teal accents for active items
- Stats cards: White backgrounds with teal accents for important metrics
- Charts: Using the teal color family for primary data, with coral and amber for alert states

### Distraction Heatmap
- Low distraction: Light teal (`#BFE1E6`)
- Medium distraction: Soft turquoise (`#5AB1BB`)
- High distraction: Deep teal (`#087E8B`)
- Very high distraction: Darker teal (`#065A64`)

### App Selection UI
- Selected apps: Highlighted with teal
- Unselected apps: Shown in neutral slate
- Counter metrics: Using the color progression from green (good) to amber to coral (needs attention)

This color scheme provides a solid foundation that can evolve with the product while maintaining its core identity of helping users reclaim their attention through mindful tracking and intentional systems.
