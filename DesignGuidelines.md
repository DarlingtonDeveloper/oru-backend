# Oru Design Guidelines

## 1. Design Philosophy

Oru is built around the principle of **mindful digital engagement**. Our design must embody this core mission through purposeful interfaces that promote:

- **Intentional Systems**: Design for habit formation rather than willpower
- **Cognitive Ease**: Reduce mental load during moments of distraction awareness 
- **Calm Technology**: Interfaces that inform without overwhelming
- **Respectful Attention**: Avoid the very patterns we help users overcome

## 2. Color System

### 2.1 Primary Brand Colors

- **Deep Teal** (`#087E8B`): Primary actions, focus elements, brand identity
- **Soft Turquoise** (`#5AB1BB`): Secondary elements, hover states, accents
- **Deep Blue-Gray** (`#252D38`): Dark mode backgrounds, headers, emphasis
- **Light Blue-Gray** (`#F5F9FC`): Light mode backgrounds, content areas

### 2.2 Semantic Colors

- **Mindful Green** (`#3EB489`): Success, progress, positive metrics
- **Muted Amber** (`#F2BB05`): Warnings, moderate usage indicators
- **Subdued Coral** (`#FF6B6B`): Errors, excessive usage alerts
- **Balanced Slate** (`#5C6E91`): Neutral UI components

### 2.3 Neutral Colors

- **Deep Slate** (`#1A2130`): Primary text, high-emphasis content
- **Slate Gray** (`#586A94`): Secondary text, medium-emphasis content
- **Light Gray** (`#9EADCB`): Tertiary text, low-emphasis content
- **Light Blue-Gray** (`#E1E8F0`): Borders, dividers, subtle separation

### 2.4 Color Usage Guidelines

- Reserve Deep Teal for primary actions and key data points
- Use color semanticallyâ€”consistently apply the same color for the same meaning
- Maintain a 4.5:1 contrast ratio between text and background for accessibility
- Limit use of Subdued Coral to truly important alerts to avoid alarm fatigue
- In data visualizations, use sequential variations of teal for related data points

## 3. Typography

### 3.1 Font Families

- **Primary Font**: Geist Sans (var(--font-geist-sans))
  - Used for all interface text, headings, and body content
- **Monospace Font**: Geist Mono (var(--font-geist-mono))
  - Used for time displays, numeric data in charts, and code examples

### 3.2 Type Scale

| Element            | Size (rem) | Weight | Line Height | Usage                             |
|--------------------|------------|--------|-------------|-----------------------------------|

- Use 24px (1.5rem) horizontal padding for mobile containers
- Use 32px (2rem) or greater horizontal padding for desktop containers
- Maximum content width of 1200px (75rem) for optimal readability

### 4.2 Spacing Scale

| Token | Size      | Usage                                            |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| xs    | 0.25rem   | Tight spacing between related elements           |
| sm    | 0.5rem    | Default spacing between related elements         |
| md    | 1rem      | Standard spacing between groups of elements      |
| lg    | 1.5rem    | Spacing between distinct sections                |
| xl    | 2rem      | Major section separations                        |
| 2xl   | 3rem      | Page section separations                         |

- Use heat maps for time/day patterns
- Apply consistent color scheme across all visualizations
- Include appropriate labels and context directly in visualizations
- Provide empty states and zero states for all visualizations

### 7.2 Data Representation Principles

- Show the most important metrics at the highest visual hierarchy
- Provide appropriate context for all metrics
- Use change indicators (â†‘â†“) with semantic colors for trends
- Round numbers appropriately to avoid false precision
- Use appropriate units and abbreviations consistently

### 7.3 Data Density

- Progressive disclosure from overview to detail
- Avoid overloading single visualizations with too many data series
- Use small multiples rather than complex multi-series charts when appropriate
- Prioritize clarity over decoration

## 8. Motion & Animation

### 8.1 Transitions

- Subtle transitions between states (150-250ms duration)
- Use ease-out timing functions for entering elements
- Use ease-in timing functions for exiting elements
- Avoid animations that delay user interaction

### 8.2 Animation Purpose

- Use animation to:
  - Connect user actions to system responses
