## Notes for Design Team
This persona represents our primary user—a digital professional who is mindful of their screen time but struggles to maintain healthy boundaries with technology. They're looking for data-driven insights rather than strict limitations, and they value systems that help them build better habits through awareness.

When designing for Alex, remember that they're not trying to eliminate technology, but to develop a healthier relationship with it. Features should empower and inform, not shame or restrict.
